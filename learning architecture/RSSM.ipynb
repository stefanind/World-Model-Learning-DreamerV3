    "The RSSM is an important part of what makes Dreamer a world model. It helps compress past experiences into a hidden state and predict the future, given some actions. Basically, it tells the agent what the world might look like after taking actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a state-space model, which represents the world as a *latent state* s_t. This is a smaller, more abstract representation of the observation image, i.e., the encoder of the RSSM alters the images' representation into a more compact, abstract encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "The recurrent structure updates this state over time, while taking into account the history of the past sequence of actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also has a prediction abililty. Using the latent state, it will predict the next observation (e.g., make an image by decoding the latent representation), it will predict rewards, and it will predict the next latent state without the need of an observation (this is where its *imagination* rollout happens)."
